            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Equivalent which can moſt ſpeedily put an end to the Differences which the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> hath with <hi>Spain,</hi> is the Delivery up of the City of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi> in its preſent condition, or even demoliſhed; with the few Villages and Hamlets depending upon it, which are not above Fourteen or Fifteen.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perſiſt ſtill in refuſing this Propoſal, the ſecond Equivalent whereunto his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, will be <hi>Dixmude</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> with their Dependencies; of which however the Town of <hi>Deinſe</hi> and its Dependence (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one of the Diſtricts which compoſe the <hi>Chaſtellenie</hi> of <hi>Courtray)</hi> ſhall remain to <hi>Spain:</hi> The Fortifications of <hi>Dixmude</hi> and <hi>Courtray</hi> to be demoliſhed, as alſo the Citadel of <hi>Courtray,</hi> in ſuch manner as onely to leave a Wall to incloſe them, for the ſecurity of the Manufactures and Commerce of thoſe two Cities.</p>
            <p>Further, The Villages belonging to the <hi>Chaſtellenie</hi> of <hi>Aeth,</hi> which having been annexed to the Government of <hi>Tournay,</hi> have been with the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi>'s conſent diſmembred by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that there might be no delay to the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of a Peace. <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Bouvines,</hi> with the Villages and Places which depend on them, of which there remain not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

            <p>And as by means of this Accommodation, there will remain for the future no cauſe of a Rupture, becauſe all the Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on both ſides will be reduced ſolely to what each Party hath been in poſſeſſion of for above a Year, without any other change than what this Equivalent is to contain, there will be no difficulty to maintain that Tranquillity in the Low Countries, which the Neighbouring Princes and States do deſire.</p>
            <p>But if the Catholique King deſire rather to give an Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> or in <hi>Navarre,</hi> his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> will be content, as to the firſt, with that part of the County of <hi>Cerdagne</hi> which the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> now has, whereof <hi>Puycerda,</hi> now entirely demoliſhed, is a part, with the <hi>Seu d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rgell,</hi> of <hi>Camprede,</hi> and with <hi>Caſtelfaillite,</hi> and their Dependencies. Or elſe with <hi>Roſe, Gironne,</hi> and <hi>Cap de Quiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the Frontiers of <hi>Navarre,</hi> with <hi>Pampelune</hi> and <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabie,</hi> and their Dependencies.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Conditions upon which a good and ſure Peace may be again eſtabliſhed before the end of the Year: and that no cauſe may remain to diſturb it in the Empire, his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> declares, That provided the Emperour and the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> accept, within the ſame Term, the Truce that hath been offered, either for Thirty, Twenty five, or even Twenty years, his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> will again empower the Sieur <hi>Verjus</hi> to Conclude it; and will conſent, That all the Princes and States of <hi>Europe</hi> be Guarantees of both Treaties.</p>
            <p>But if ſome of theſe Propoſals, the Choice whereof is left to the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> be not accepted before the end of this Year, and the Poſſeſſion delivered up to the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> of thoſe Places which he offers to take for an Equivalent, His <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> not onely pretends to be no longer obliged to ſtand to theſe Conditions, but even thinks, he ſhall have great reaſon to procure himſelf Satisfaction for thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Expences he ſhall be forced to be at in taking poſſeſſion of what belongs to him; and that all the Miſchiefs of a War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Spain,</hi> after they had refuſed all means of an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, can be imputed to none but them, and the Support given them by their Allies.</p>
